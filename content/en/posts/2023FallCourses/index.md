## Operating System

- Course Name: Operating System
- Permanent Course ID: CSIC30015
- Instructor: Prof. Chun-Feng Wu

### Course Content
Since I didn’t take the undergraduate OS course offered by NYCU, I’m not sure how it compares. However, it feels different from the one at NTHU. Prof. Chou’s OS course at NTHU seemed to covered each component briefly, while this one dives deeper into each topic, though not extensively due to time constraints. The instructor seems to specialize in memory systems (he offers a course called *Memory and Storage Systems* next semester), so that part was particularly detailed and clear.

### Class Format
The course is conducted in English, with both online and in-person options. Recordings of the lectures, including student questions, are available. I only attended the first class and the midterm/final exams in-person, though.

### Exams and Assignments
- **20% Midterm Exam**
  - Past papers are available on NCTUPlus and Dcard. The midterm was similar to last year’s, with an additional section of true/false questions. Full marks exceeded 100.
- **30% Final Exam**
  - No review session, and the exam papers were not returned. The final covered topics from the midterm, so review thoroughly.
- **20% Paper Presentation**
  - This year, due to class size, presentations were in pairs, with each lasting 12–15 minutes. Papers had to be selected from conferences like USENIX OSDI, USENIX ATC, USENIX FAST, SOSP, ASPLOS, HPCA, ACM SC, ISCA, MICRO, and EuroSys, or other Rank A papers of 10+ pages.
  - Presenting in Week 2 or Week 3 earned bonus points (2 and 1, respectively). English presentations also gained 2 bonus points.
- **30% Homework**
  - **Assignment 1:** Modify Linux's `uname` and implement a simple system call (requires a virtual machine).
  - **Assignment 2:** Implement different scheduling policies using pthread.
  - **Assignment 3:** Write a kernel module to print system information.
- **10% Class Participation (1 question = 2 points)**

### Additional Notes
Attendance is not mandatory, and questions can be asked online.

### Final Thoughts
The instructor’s English is excellent, and even at double speed, it’s comprehensible. He’s good at explaining and clarifying doubts, revisiting them in the next class if needed. Due to the bonus system, many students actively asked questions. The grading curve was generous, with an average of 86.85 and several students scoring over 100.

Students present progress updates and give reports. Occasionally, there are guest lectures, and students can suggest topics to Sophi (the PM).

Weekly presentations by one or two students, followed by progress updates from everyone. Prof. Cheng provides suggestions but does not enforce anything. Issues related to teamwork can also be raised and addressed to Sophi. The course usually ends at about 2:30 PM.

### Exams and Assignments
No exams. Grades are based on the semester’s development progress, and an A+ is likely if you stay on track.

### Additional Notes
Absences are allowed but shouldn’t be excessive.

### Final Thoughts
This course offers rare group time for 戊組 students. Both the instructor and Sophi are approachable and helpful.
